      "- Take that Zuckerberg 😎 I hated Instagram anyways. The idea of a “finsta” was created because so many people felt insecure about posting on their page. That app is too toxic now. That’s why we created a safe space for you to document your memories and share them with select people (without judgement and randos seeing them).  Like you should be able to rememeber every small moment in your life that made you happy. Sometimes if we never snap a pic, we’ll forget about it…or it will get lost in our photos.  We hope Moment helps you romanticize your life and make life feel like your own movie with seasons and characters. You can download it rn! (Likes: 236400)\n",
